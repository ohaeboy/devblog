description: A not so How-to-Guide to getting Bootstrap working with Jekyll for Github Pages
categories: [jekyll, bootstrap]

When I learned front-end web development, I was introduced to Bootstrap and how easy it is to create quickly a responsive website. I knew from the beginning, if I were to make any blog or site, it will be using the framework for easy responsive design.

I didn't want to take long figuring out the CSS to make a responsive site from scratch. I don't really care that it looks like vanilla Bootstrap. I just want the site to work, and I wanted it done quickly. Problem was, Bootstrap doesn't work out the box with Jekyll while hosted by GitHub Pages.

I attempted a few step by step or guides on how to get it working, but they ultimately didn't work out. I thought I wouldn't be able to use GitHub Pages, and tried deploying to Netlify, but the deployment kept failing for some reason and I never got it up. So I continued to look for a solution.

I eventually came upon a [guide](https://simpleit.rocks/ruby/jekyll/tutorials/how-to-add-bootstrap-4-to-jekyll-the-right-way/) that claimed it was showing you how to do it the "right way." For me, the guide was manageable. It's probably not a guide for absolute beginners who aren't familiar with command line or Jekyll. But it got the job done.

Happy to see I got Jekyll to work with Bootstrap and also running online. Simple layout and styling for now. Nothing customized just yet. Just gonna use vanilla styling. But will change the layout at least to accommodate content.

Progress!
